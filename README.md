## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/cpp-example-plugin.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Directory**

   ```bash
   cd cpp-example-plugin
   ```

3. **Build Your Plugin**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

   This process will compile your code and produce a shared library that Endstone servers can load.

   **Note: If you wish to build against a specific version of Endstone, you can modify the `GIT_TAG` in
   the `CMakeLists.txt` file to point to the desired tag or commit.**

4. **Test Your Plugin**

   Once built, copy the output binary `endstone_example_plugin.dll` (Windows) or `endstone_example_plugin.so` (Linux) to
   the `plugins` directory of your Endstone server. Start the Endstone server and check the logs to ensure your plugin
   loads and operates as expected.
